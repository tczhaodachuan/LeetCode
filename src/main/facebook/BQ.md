1. What is the project you are most proud of?
I delivered a project last year using columnar stored file format which makes the whole system  
300% faster, 10 times smaller in disk usage. Because the success of that project, the columnar methodology has been adapted to a broad discussion within the whole department.  

The reason I am proud of it was because at the time when decision was made, my idea wasn't evaluated as the best solution.  
The team was trying to go with Spark solution, that framework doesn't require a file based solution at all, and it will provide a much scalable solution.  
I wasn't disagreed with that plan, and I was part of the decision making, but I quickly identified few obstacles in front of it, 
a. Support model change, requires a bigger discussion to get fully support from another team.  
b. Learning curve, throw away the existing infrastructure and choose a new platform without a strong reason costs lots of money and time.  
c. Given we just invested enough to move to current distributed workflow, the bottleneck is clear the file format, why don't we optimize on it and i have a sense  
it will be much faster than we thought it could be.  

We are running a business here, time to market is an important factor to evaluate the solution.  
The Spark solution was more for throwing more machines, parallelize more of the workers and achieve a better result.
My solution was do a deep dive on the existing solution, clear up the bottlenecks and add efficiency. 
I got hold lots of discussions, and I got to lay out the plan details for my team to execute. And I have to make a commitment to use two sprints for 3 persons to get the job done.  
I was betting my reputation into it, and that little success reinforce the trust from the leaders and the peers.  

2. How do you handle the conflict with your manager?  
No one is perfect, especially your manager. I have experienced two types of managers, one type of manager is that he is about to retire, rich of experiences and very patient to everything.  
It's almost impossible you will have a conflict with him, but most of the time you will feel you got ignored because the lack of feedback for the work you have done.  
This kind of manager doesn't want to take big changes or risks, so the work in the team normally doesn't inspire you so much. 
Another type of manager who has been recently promoted, eager to approve himself. Sometimes, he will show anxious about the things you plan to do. 
that's where the conflicts will raise such as disagree with the approach because the development cost is high, get frustrated if you don't deliver in timely manner. 
It happened to me, my current manager sometimes speak in a way that makes me uncomfortable, I do take the chance to hint that to my skip manager and the mentor.  
I think most of the advice I got is to work with your manager, and that's part of your work, sometimes if your manager gave you unreasonable expectations will make you better.  
I also took a class called communication styles, learned how to category ppl based on colors, red, blue, green colors ppl. How to deal with those types  in the working life.   
I thought about that, and I got to talk with another guy who is handling him very well, I got few tips from him. 
a. Don't listen to his/her attitude, listen to what he really wants? Align your idea and thoughts with his directions, no manager would like to be no direct impact on the projects he  
managed.
b. He is easily get frustrated, understand that, and express that to him you don't like that style. Maybe he will listen.  

3. How do you handle the conflicts with your peers or across the team?  
The conflicts normally happened in the technology direction, or the technology stack choice. There is a base principle, everyone wants to be part of it  
if it's a new and better architecture. The conflict comes when you showed that you choose the abrupt plan without considering the environments in the firm.  
Like I was trying to introduce Kafka Streaming into the tech stack, a lots of push back is that why not using RabbitMQ?  
The streaming solution is lack of control flow, where the existing infrastructure actually can make up that part. Thus I got to change my plan to integrate both systems.
I offered help when they are struggling with their issues toward us, like they were having memory issues in the base line software, I am offering my expertise in memory 
profiling, and I helped them identified 2 libraries which are functionally simple but used lots of memory. The company is an echo system, no team can survive by himself. So when I ask for a help or a change,  
the cross team will definitely give a concern.  

4 What project you have fought for but it proves you are wrong?  
That happens, sometimes, I may not fully understand things, the situation is more complex than I thought. There was a time we need to determine the priority for a bunch of jobs which contain bigger and smaller jobs.  
My thought is that given the same priority, it will slow down the whole process speed, like we need process the smaller jobs first to freeze up resources for the longer job.  
We had a discussion, one of the team member said there will be no differences if you change the priority for smaller jobs. The total time is unchangeable. 
I think I may have unconscious bias to think that he may not fully understand that question, until I got home, I still have the same conversation with my wife, and we discussed about like  
two hours and draw lots of pictures, then I realized the time to process those jobs won't change even we reshuffle them.  
Because the longer job doesn't get split up, it still needs that many resources. Fight with unconscious assumption and bias is hard, I am trying to be more scientific and data driven.  

5 Why Facebook?  
It's a good question, why do I look for a change if I am good at my current job and there is nothing wrong in the role.  The only reason for me to change to FB  
is the my own career goal, I target myself as the top tier software developers and I like to build my name on a big scale projects like Cassandra, Pytorch. If you look my past experiences I majorly focus on financial technology.  
The tech work in finance normally focus on stability and safety, tolerate more on the speed and scale. To become a top tier developer i need to solve the top tier problems,  
given the scale of the users activities in the social network, I feel the companies like FB is trying to solve the hardest problems in the tech world, which is the better ground for me to grow.  
Branding of the FB is the technology leader, I would like to become part of it and grow with it, that's the longer thought of this.
